  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is properly done with a .css file listing all CSS commands for your website.<br> 
  Another way to do CSS is using the style tag at the top head part of a webpage.<br> 

  Here is a typical in-document style:
  <pre>
    b { 
      color: #00f00;
    }
  </pre><br> 

  I do CSS inline inside the tag. It overpowers all other methods. <br><br> 
  <i>This is Italic</i> <br> 
  <i id="myB1" style="color: #00ff00; background-color: blue;">Some text with color and background</i>

  <button onclick="changeStyles()">Change</button>
  
  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> 

  <img src="myImage01.jpg" width="200" style="border-radius: 200px;">

  <script>
    function changeStyles() {
      var myB1 = document.getElementById('myB1');
      var myTextArea = document.getElementById('myTextArea');

      myB1.style.color = 'red';
      myB1.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';

      <div id="myTextArea">
  Once upon a time there was a teacher named <span class="italic">Mr. Ellise</span>. He was marking the project of a geriatric high schooler. 
        As he was marking the text he couldn't help but be baffled by the seemingly nonexistence textarea within the CSS document. 
          <span class="italic">He must be lazy.</span> Mr. Ellise thought. Those words were like a mantra for Mr. Ellise. <span class="bold">Click</span> 
          He clicked the button which was supposed to cause the italic text to change colors and for some strange reason the text area appeared. 
          <span class="italic">Matthew is a very smart human.</span> Mr. Ellise thought.
    </div>
    }
  </script>

  <textarea id="myTextArea" style="background-image: url('myImgNew.jpg'); position:relative; left:0; top:0; width:300px; height:200px;">
    This is a text area. Not a text arena.
  </textarea>
